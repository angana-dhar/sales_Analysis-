Sales Analysis Project Overview
The Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing user ratings for various products.
The dataset includes key attributes such as item_id, user_id, rating, timestamp, model_attr, category, brand, year, user_attr, and a split indicator for training/testing purposes.
The primary aim of this project is to uncover insights about consumer preferences and behaviors over time. By examining the ratings data, we can identify trends in customer satisfaction, compare product categories and brands, and understand how different demographics influence purchasing decisions.
Key components of the analysis include:
Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and contents of the dataset.
Statistical Analysis: Calculating descriptive statistics to summarize the ratings.
Visualizations: Creating various graphs such as histograms, line graphs, box plots, and bar charts to visualize trends and comparisons.
This project serves as a valuable tool for businesses seeking to enhance their marketing strategies and product offerings based on data-driven insights. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide through the analysis process, making it accessible for users with basic programming knowledge.
